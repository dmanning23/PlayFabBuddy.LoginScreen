# PlayFabBuddy.LoginScreen
Feature-complete login screen for logging into PlayFab with MonoGame and the "Buddy" system.

If you aren't using the MenuBuddy gui library, this isn't for you :( unless you are just interested in an example of setting up the rest of the playfabbuddy stuff.

There is a complete sample game showing how to use this project at https://github.com/dmanning23/PlayFabAuthExample

good luck :P
